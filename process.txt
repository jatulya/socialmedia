Frontend
--------
1. Create an account in appwrite
2. npm create vite@latest ./ 
   click on react and typescript in the drop down list that would be shown. -> creates a vite+react app at current repository 
   npm install
   npm run dev
3. move the assets from src to public
4. delete unnecessary files
5. create a new file in src folder named App.tsx
6.  Setting the tailwind
   create a new file named globals.css and add tailwind directives there
   configure the tailwind path
   import globals.css in app.tsx
   update the tailwind.config.js 
   npm install -D tailwindcss-animate
   close the server
   run again
   add the necessary class names to get the css styling
7. Setting the routes
   npm install react-router-dom
   import {BrowserRouter} from react-router-dom in main.tsx
   wrap the app with BrowserRouter in main
   in app, import {routes, route} and add routes
8. folder structure
   create _auth and _root in src
   in _auth, another folder forms that contains signin and signup forms
   _auth also contains a file AuthLayout to wrap the forms and other design in a single page
   _root contains dashboard and other main pages
   since there would be many pages to display, rather than importing each one of them in the app page , we create a file in pages name index.ts and write code as export {default as Home} from './Home' along with other pages to import it in a single line.
   in app.tsx it would look like this import {Home, page1, page2
   } from './_root/pages'
9. Shad cn ui 
   follow their documentation
   npx various components and use accordingly
10. set up AuthLayout
   import outlet and navigate from dom
